This is a open source TensorFlow implementation for "Multi-Granularity Hierarchical Attention Fusion Networks for Reading Comprehension and Question Answering" paper by Alibaba for Squad dataset. 

1) To train the network run the following command
python main.py --experiment_name=baseline --mode=train
2) For inference run the following command
python main.py --experiment_name=baseline --mode=show_examples
3) For running in Manual question and answer mode run the following command
python main.py --experiment_name=baseline --mode=compare
